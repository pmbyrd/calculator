# Calculator

## Components

A simple single page front end calculator project consisting of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### HTML

The HTML is used with the assisting based off of original notes taken made in this project for adding a few extra challenges for myself beyond the orinal scope of just creating a calculator to add, subtract, multiple and divide.

The model for the calculator can be found here for the values that where used to expand this project.

The values are then appled with appropriate inputs and classes to be used for styling and functionality which is demonstrated in this small snippet.

````HTML
    <!-- Example snippet not in actual order of code -->
    <input type="button" value="m-" class="memory memory-minus" />
    <input type="button" value="âˆšx" class="math-func square-root" />
    <input type="reset" value="CE" class="clear clear-entry" />
    <input type="button" value="%" class="math-func percent" />
    <input type="button" value="0" class="number zero" />
